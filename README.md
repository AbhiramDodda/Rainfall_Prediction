# Rainfall_Prediction
My first Machine Learning Model

We did this project as a team for AAC, an academic club in my college.

### Dataset
The dataset we used is croped from the original dataset found on Kaggle. We wanted to predict average annual rainfall. The dataset initially did not have average temperatures column so we had to take another dataset which had annual average temperatures and merged both.


### Model
The model we used is multiple linear regression.
